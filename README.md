An interactive journal named Sprout.

IMPORTANT!

To run this app you will need an Android Emulator (Android Sudio)
- Pixel 4 API 33 was used for this project.

Or an android mobile connected via USB.
- A Galaxy S23 was also used for this project.

to run the app type 'flutter run' into the terminal - NOTE, this may take a while to build especially for the first time.


The code is set up to simulate a new user, opening the app for the first time as well as real time streak updates. Therefore upon running, the streak will only update by one, since its only being tested on a single day. However, to watch the plant grow and skip realtime, please see main for instructions on which line/s of code to uncomment. This will bypass the LastCheckIn logic.
